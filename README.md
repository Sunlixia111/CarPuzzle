# Round & Split

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukhnos/roundandsplit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukhnos/roundandsplit)

I needed a tip calculator, so I wrote one.

I always round my tips, and when I dine out with a friend, I email them
reminders that I owe them money or vice versa. I was looking for a tip
calculator that could do both, but there wasn't any. Plus, most tip calculators
out there have a lot of features that I don't need.

So I decided to make one. Or two in fact – I've made an iOS version and an
Android version, because I happen to know programming on both platforms.

I've also made this an open source project. You are welcome to build the app
on your own from the source code.

## Description
<br>
Round & Split is a tip calculator designed for highly effective people like you. It has three features that I think you'll like:
<br>
The total is always a whole number.
<br>
This makes it easy to pay (especially in cash!) and process mentally.
<br>
Send an email reminder from within the app. 
<br>
Send an email to remind your dining partner to pay you or request the share. The subject line is pre-populated with the split amount.
<br>

## Features

* Calculate tip at three most common rates in the United States: 15%, 18%, and
  20%.
* Always give you a rounded total.
* Send email reminder with pre-populated subject lines.


## On Rounding

When Round & Split rounds the total for you, the rounding can go up or down.
Which direction it goes depends on the effective rate of the tip. The rate
that is closest to your chosen rate wins.

For example, if the charged amount is $37.14, and you want to tip at 18%,
the tip would be $6.69 (37.14 × 18% = 6.69) and the total $43.83, which is
a bit unwieldy for a total. If we round the total down to $43.00, the tip
becomes $5.86, which translate to an effective rate of 15.8%
(5.86/37.14 = 0.158). On the other hand, if we round it up to $44.00, the tip
becomes $6.86, and the effective rate 18.5% (6.86/37.14 = 0.185). 18.5% is
closer to 18%, and so we use $6.86 as the tip and $44.00 as the total. The
point is that I want neither overtipping nor undertipping too much.
